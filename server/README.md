## Usage

If you wish to deploy this project on a server hosted remotely, you might want to be using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers. You can perform the same using this command:

```bash
PORT=8002 docker-compose up -d --build
```

Once completed, you will notice that you have a docker container running on the port you selected, which can process requests just like any django server.
